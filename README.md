Minimalist eBook Reader for InkPlate 6

InkPlate 6 is a 600 x 800 pixel e-ink screen from a recycled Kindle, mounted on a board with an ESP32 module. The board also includes an SD card socket, a USB connector and a charging system for a lithium battery. Although the screen does not provide a touch interface, three separate touch pads are mounted along one edge of the screen. The aim of this project was to produce a minimalist eBook reader using this hardware.
